Hi there, I’m @berrynp76

I’m interested in data analytics and decision sciences for complex enterprises, specifically financial institutions and government clients.
  (for interested parties, I have an active security clearance that's higher than your average bear)

I’m currently learning C#, the broader .NET framework, and cloud integrations while completing my MBA at the University of North Carolina. 
Going forward, I'm quite keen on learning Q# and how to make best use of a quantum powered ecosystem to empower organizations to make smart decisions. 

I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything that helps make the world a better place 
  (but my skillset lends itself towards C# Windows applications and related services). 

To reach me: Find me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/berrynp/ or feel free to shoot me a message there or here on GitHub. 
  
If you see me out and about in the PNW, I'm the one with the beard ;) 

Cheers!
