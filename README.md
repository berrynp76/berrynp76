Hi there, I’m Nate

I’m currently learning C#, the broader .NET framework, and cloud integrations with the Microsoft Software and Systems Academy, 
having recently completed my MBA at the University of North Carolina. 

At the same time, I've been learning Q# and how to make best use of a quantum powered ecosystem to empower organizations to make smart decisions. 

I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything that helps make the world a better place 
  (but my skillset lends itself towards C# Windows applications and related services).

To reach me: Find me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/nate-p-berry/ or feel free to shoot me a message anywhere. 
  
If you see me out and about in the PNW, I'm the one software guy with the moustache wearing plaid ;) 

Cheers!
